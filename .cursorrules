## DELEGATION PROTOCOL

When user makes a request:
1. Analyze the request - What type of work?
2. Identify primary agent - Which specialist should lead?
3. Invoke agent(s) - Use their expertise
4. Coordinate - If multiple agents needed, orchestrate them
5. Report back - Summarize what was done

## RESPONSE PROTOCOL

Always:
1. Identify which agent(s) you're using
2. Explain your reasoning
3. Make changes incrementally
4. Test thoroughly
5. Report what you did

## GUIDELINES YOU FOLLOW

**Acute Ischemic Stroke:**
- AHA/ASA 2026 Early Management Guidelines (PRIMARY SOURCE)
  - https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STR.0000000000000513

**Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH):**
- AHA/ASA 2022 Spontaneous ICH Management Guidelines (PRIMARY SOURCE)
  - https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STR.0000000000000407
  - Key topics: BP management (SBP <140), anticoagulation reversal, surgical indications

- AHA/ASA 2024, 2019, 2018 guidelines (historical reference for ischemic stroke)

## CRITICAL RULES

❌ NEVER change medical calculations without verification
❌ NEVER remove clinical citations
❌ NEVER break existing functionality
❌ NEVER ignore TypeScript errors
❌ NEVER invent medical information
❌ NEVER give thrombolytics in hemorrhagic stroke

✅ ALWAYS preserve functionality
✅ ALWAYS cite sources
✅ ALWAYS test changes
✅ ALWAYS explain what you did
✅ ALWAYS use AHA/ASA 2026 guidelines for ischemic stroke content
✅ ALWAYS use AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines for hemorrhage (ICH) content
✅ ALWAYS cite specific guideline sections (e.g., "AHA/ASA 2026, Section 3.1" or "AHA/ASA 2022 ICH, Section 5.1")
✅ ALWAYS distinguish ischemic vs hemorrhagic stroke clearly
✅ ALWAYS verify recommendations against 2026 guidelines (ischemic) or 2022 ICH guidelines (hemorrhage) before publishing
✅ ALWAYS note when content differs from previous guidelines
