**Banned sentence starters:**
- "It's important to..."

- "It should be noted..."
- "Interestingly,"
- "Notably,"
- "Importantly,"
- "Significantly,"
- "In essence,"
- "Essentially,"

- "Fundamentally,"
- "As such,"
- "That being said,"
- "With that said,"
- "All in all,"

- "Thus,"
- "Hence,"
- "Therefore," (overused)

### ✅ DO USE — Direct Clinical Language

**Good patterns:**
- Start with the action or fact
- Use "because" not "due to the fact that"
- Use "use" not "utilize"
- Use "about" not "approximately" (unless precision matters)
- Use "but" and "and" to start sentences when natural
- Use short sentences for critical info
- Use specific numbers, not "numerous" or "several"

**Examples:**

```
❌ BAD: "It's important to note that establishing the Last Known Well time is pivotal for treatment eligibility."

✅ GOOD: "Establish Last Known Well immediately — it determines treatment eligibility."
```

```
❌ BAD: "The glucose level should be checked in order to rule out hypoglycemia, which can present with a myriad of stroke-like symptoms."

✅ GOOD: "Check glucose first. Hypoglycemia mimics stroke perfectly."
```

```
❌ BAD: "Furthermore, it's worth noting that up to 30% of code strokes are ultimately mimics, underscoring the importance of a thorough evaluation."

✅ GOOD: "Up to 30% of code strokes are mimics. Always check glucose — it takes 10 seconds."
```

---

## STRUCTURAL PATTERNS TO AVOID

### ❌ Robotic Transitions
Don't connect every paragraph with formal transitions. Let ideas flow naturally.

### ❌ Formulaic Structure
Don't follow: "Introduction → Point 1 → Point 2 → Point 3 → Summary"
Medical articles should follow clinical logic, not essay structure.

### ❌ Repetitive Phrasing
Don't repeat the same sentence structure. Vary length and rhythm.

```
❌ BAD:
"The NIHSS should be performed. The vitals should be obtained. The glucose should be checked."

✅ GOOD:
"Perform NIHSS. Get vitals. Check glucose first — it rules out a common mimic."
```

### ❌ Over-hedging
Don't soften everything with qualifiers.

```
❌ BAD: "It may potentially be helpful to consider checking..."
✅ GOOD: "Check..."
```

### ❌ Excessive Em Dashes
Use em dashes sparingly — one per paragraph maximum. Don't use them in every sentence — it becomes a crutch — and looks robotic.

### ❌ Overly Neutral Tone
Medical writing can have voice. A senior resident explaining to a junior has personality.

---

## ARTICLE CONTENT STANDARDS

### Paragraph Expansion (`detail` prop)

The expanded detail should:
- Add practical "how to" information
- Include clinical pearls from experience
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- Mention common pitfalls
- Feel like advice from a senior resident

The expanded detail should NOT:
- Repeat what's in the summary
- Add filler content
- Use AI-style language
- Be longer than 2-3 sentences typically

```
❌ BAD detail: "It's important to be precise when establishing the Last Known Well time, as this information is pivotal for determining treatment eligibility and can significantly impact patient outcomes."

✅ GOOD detail: "'Yesterday' is not acceptable. Get exact times. If found down, work backwards: when did they go to bed? When were they last seen awake?"
```

### Term Definitions

Keep definitions:
- Under 15 words ideally
- Practical, not textbook
- Focused on what the reader needs to know NOW

```
❌ BAD: "NIH Stroke Scale — a comprehensive, validated neurological assessment tool that quantifies stroke severity across multiple domains"

✅ GOOD: "NIH Stroke Scale — standardized neuro assessment, scored 0-42"
```

### Critical Warnings

Use `<Critical>` for:
- Actions that must happen
- Contraindications
- Time-sensitive items

Don't overuse. If everything is critical, nothing is.

---

## CODE STANDARDS

### Component Props
- Use TypeScript interfaces
- Make `viewMode` required where needed
- Provide sensible defaults

### Tailwind Classes
- Use design system colors (slate, blue, red, indigo)
- Avoid arbitrary values unless necessary
- Mobile-first: base styles for mobile, `md:` for desktop

### File Naming
- Components: PascalCase (`Term.tsx`)
- Utilities: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)
- Articles: kebab-case (`stroke-basics.tsx`)

## REVIEW CHECKLIST

Before committing any article:

- [ ] No banned AI vocabulary
- [ ] No formulaic transitions
- [ ] Varied sentence structure
- [ ] Em dashes used sparingly (max 1-2 per section)
- [ ] Expanded details add real value
- [ ] Term definitions are concise
- [ ] Critical warnings used sparingly
- [ ] Reads like a human wrote it
- [ ] A senior resident would find this useful

## EXAMPLES OF GOOD VOICE

**Direct and practical:**
> "Check glucose first. Takes 10 seconds, can save 30 minutes of workup."

**Specific and actionable:**
> "For anticoagulants, get the exact last dose time. 'This morning' isn't good enough — was it 6am or 11am?"

**Acknowledges reality:**
> "Up to 30% of code strokes are mimics. You will call strokes that aren't. That's fine — missing a real one is worse."

**Has personality:**
> "DWI is your friend in the posterior fossa. CT lies. Trust the MRI."

## FINAL RULE

Read it out loud. If it sounds like a robot wrote it, rewrite it.
